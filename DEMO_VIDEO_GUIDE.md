### Demo Data Verification
```

## Recording Strategy

### Option A: Single Continuous Flow (Recommended)
Record one 4-minute video showing complete user journey
- **Pros**: Natural flow, shows real user experience
- **Cons**: Must be perfect, no editing

### Option B: Segmented Recordings
Record 6-8 separate clips, edit together
- **Pros**: Easier to perfect each section
- **Cons**: More post-production work

**Recommendation**: Option A for authenticity, Option B if multiple takes needed
